# gulp-starter-kit

If you want to know how to build that kind of startet kit you can watch the YouTube videos I created while working on this starter kit: https://goo.gl/sMFmyN (Note: Videos are in Polish).

## Usage

### 1. Clone repo
```
git clone https://github.com/marcinkrzeminski/gulp-starter-kit.git
```

### 2. Go inside cloned repo
```
cd gulp-starter-kit
```

### 3. Install all dependencies (make sure nodejs with npm is installed on your machine)
```
npm install
```

### 4. Run default gulp task (will open browser window with live reload)
```
gulp
```

## Build 

In order to build the production version of your project run __gulp build__ from the root of cloned repo.
